<h2>Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining with Double-Layer Span Extraction</h2>

The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) method with Double-Layer span extraction framework to overcome this issue and simultaneously mine aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondance in joint model.

<h3> Dataset </h3>

The experiments are conducted on SemEval 14, 15, 16 restaurant and SemEval 14 Laptop datasets.
